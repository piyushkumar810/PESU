# Question 2: Single Heart Rate Sensor During Daily Activity
'''
A wearable heart rate sensor tracks a person’s heart rate for one day.
You are required to:

Context:-
One wearable heart rate sensor tracks daily activity.
Simulation Requirements
Generate data for 24 hours
Sampling interval: 5 seconds
Heart rate baseline should vary during sleep and activity
Inject exercise sessions
Simulate heart rate recovery after exercise
Inject sensor dropouts during motion

Pandas Tasks:-
Infer sleep and active periods
Detect exercise sessions
Calculate recovery time
Flag abnormal heart rate episodes
Generate a daily fitness summary table

📌 Note:
Context → what data represents
Simulation requirements → how data is generated
Pandas tasks → analysis + dataframe + visualization
1 hour = 60 records (based on given sampling)
