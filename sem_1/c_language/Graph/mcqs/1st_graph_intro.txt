🎯 DEGREE IN DIRECTED GRAPH (STEP-BY-STEP)
1️⃣ First: What is a DIRECTED GRAPH?

A directed graph (digraph) has arrows on edges.

Example:

A → B
C → B
D → B
B → E
B → F


Here arrows matter.

2️⃣ Two DIFFERENT types of degree in directed graphs
🔹 (A) Indegree

➡️ Number of edges coming INTO a vertex

Think:
👉 “How many arrows are pointing to me?”

Example:

C → B
A → B
D → B


Indegree of B = 3

🔹 (B) Outdegree

➡️ Number of edges going OUT from a vertex

Think:
👉 “How many arrows leave me?”

Example:

B → E
B → F


Outdegree of B = 2

3️⃣ What is TOTAL DEGREE in a directed graph?

📌 Total degree = Indegree + Outdegree

This is the key formula.

4️⃣ Now apply to your MCQ
Given:

Indegree = 3

Outdegree = 2

Calculation:
Total degree = 3 + 2 = 5


✅ Correct answer: C. 5

5️⃣ PICTURIZE IT (VERY IMPORTANT 🧠)

Imagine the vertex as YOU 👤

3 people are sending messages to you → indegree = 3

You are sending messages to 2 people → outdegree = 2

📊 Total interactions involving you = 5

That’s the total degree.

6️⃣ COMMON EXAM CONFUSION (READ THIS!)

❌ Wrong thought:

“Total degree is not defined in directed graph”

👉 ❌ WRONG

✔ Correct:

Indegree → defined

Outdegree → defined

Total degree → indegree + outdegree

7️⃣ QUICK COMPARISON (MCQ GOLD)
Graph Type	Degree Meaning
Undirected	Degree = number of edges connected
Directed	Total degree = indegree + outdegree
