/*
Write a C Program to do the following 

Addition of Polynomials: Implement a function that adds two polynomials represented as linked lists, where each node contains a coefficient and a degree.
â–¡ Hint: Traverse both lists simultaneously, summing the coefficients of terms with the same degree. Add the resulting terms to a new polynomial linked list.

typedef struct mynode {
      int data; 
      structure dynode *link;
} *NODE;
