TREE – REPRESENTATION (DSA UNIT)

❓ How many ways can a Tree be represented?
👉 MAINLY TWO ways (as you said):

-> Array Representation
-> Linked List Representation
(Internally, there are sub-types, but exam answer = these two)

------------------------------------------
---1️⃣ ARRAY REPRESENTATION OF TREE
🧠 IDEA

Store tree elements in an array
Mostly used for Binary Trees
Parent–child relationship is found using index formula

📌 Index Rules (VERY IMPORTANT ⭐)
If a node is at index i:

Relationship	     Index
Root	             0
Left child	         2*i + 1
Right child	         2*i + 2
Parent	             (i-1)/2

eg:-
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F

Array stores:- 

Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5
Array:  A  B  C  D  E  F
