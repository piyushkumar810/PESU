✅ Answer: D

Q15) AVL trees guarantee height:

A. O(n)
B. O(n log n)
C. O(log n)
D. O(1)

✅ Answer: C

🧠 EXAM MEMORY BLOCK (VERY IMPORTANT)
AVL = Self-balancing BST
Balance Factor ∈ {−1, 0, +1}
LL, RR → Single rotations
LR, RL → Double rotations
Height always O(log n)



//------------------------------- hard Concept
🔹 Q11) Height of an empty AVL tree = −1
First: what is HEIGHT?

👉 Height = longest path (number of edges) from node to leaf

📌 Rule used in AVL (very important):

Height of leaf node = 0

Height of empty tree = -1

🧠 VISUALIZE THIS
Case 1️⃣: Empty tree
(no nodes)


There is:

❌ no root

❌ no edges

❌ no path

👉 So we define:

height = -1


Why?
Because it makes formulas clean:

height(node) = max(height(left), height(right)) + 1

Case 2️⃣: One node tree
   A


Left child = empty → height = -1

Right child = empty → height = -1

So:

height(A) = max(-1, -1) + 1 = 0


✔️ Leaf height becomes 0
✔️ Empty tree must be -1

That’s why
✅ Correct Answer: B (−1)



🔹 Q13) Which operation may violate AVL balance?

Answer: Insertion

Now let’s see why.

🧠 What does AVL balance mean?

For every node:

balance factor = height(left) − height(right)
Allowed values: -1, 0, +1

🟢 SEARCH (Safe)
Just moves pointer ↓
Does NOT change structure


✔ No new nodes
✔ Heights unchanged
✔ Balance unchanged

🟢 TRAVERSAL (Safe)
Just visits nodes


✔ Read-only operation
✔ No insertion or deletion

🟢 DISPLAY (Safe)
Just printing

🔴 INSERTION (DANGEROUS)

Let’s visualize

Before insertion
    10
   /
  5


Balanced ✔
BF(10) = 1

Insert 2
    10
   /
  5
 /
2


Now:

height(left) = 2

height(right) = 0

BF(10) = 2 ❌ (not allowed)


💥 AVL property BROKEN

👉 Rotation needed (LL rotation)

Why only insertion breaks balance?

Because insertion:

adds new node

increases height

can cause imbalance

So
✅ Correct Answer: C (Insertion)

🧠 ONE-LINE MEMORY TRICK

Empty tree height = −1 → makes leaf height = 0 ✔

Only operations that change structure can break balance

Insert ❌

Delete ❌

Search / traversal / display ✅
