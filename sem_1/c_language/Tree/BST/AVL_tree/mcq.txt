✅ Answer: C

Q3) Valid balance factor values for an AVL node are:

A. −2, −1, 0, 1, 2
B. −1, 0, 1
C. 0, 1
D. −1, 1

✅ Answer: B

Q4) If the balance factor of a node becomes +2 after insertion, the tree is:

A. Right heavy
B. Left heavy
C. Balanced
D. Complete

✅ Answer: B

Q5) Which rotation is used when insertion happens in the left subtree of left child?

A. RR
B. RL
C. LR
D. LL

✅ Answer: D

Q6) Which rotation is used when insertion happens in the right subtree of right child?

A. LL
B. LR
C. RL
D. RR

✅ Answer: D

Q7) LR rotation is a combination of:

A. Right then Left
B. Left then Right
C. Two Right rotations
D. Two Left rotations

✅ Answer: B

Q8) RL rotation is performed when:

A. Insertion in left of left subtree
B. Insertion in right of right subtree
C. Insertion in left of right subtree
D. Insertion in right of left subtree

✅ Answer: C

Q9) After how many rotations can an AVL tree be rebalanced after insertion?

A. Exactly one
B. At most one
C. At most two
D. Depends on height

✅ Answer: C

Q10) Time complexity of search in AVL tree is:

A. O(n)
B. O(log n)
C. O(n log n)
D. O(1)

✅ Answer: B

Q11) Height of an empty AVL tree is defined as:

A. 0
B. −1
C. 1
D. Undefined

✅ Answer: B

Q12) AVL trees differ from BST because AVL trees:

A. Allow duplicate keys
B. Are always complete
C. Are self-balancing
D. Use queues

✅ Answer: C

Q13) Which operation may violate AVL balance?

A. Search
B. Traversal
C. Insertion
D. Display

✅ Answer: C
(Deletion also violates, but not listed)

Q14) If multiple nodes become unbalanced after insertion, which node is rotated?

A. Root
B. First unbalanced node from root
C. Last unbalanced node from root
D. Closest unbalanced node to inserted leaf

✅ Answer: D

Q15) AVL trees guarantee height:

A. O(n)
B. O(n log n)
C. O(log n)
D. O(1)

✅ Answer: C

🧠 EXAM MEMORY BLOCK (VERY IMPORTANT)
AVL = Self-balancing BST
Balance Factor ∈ {−1, 0, +1}
LL, RR → Single rotations
LR, RL → Double rotations
Height always O(log n)
