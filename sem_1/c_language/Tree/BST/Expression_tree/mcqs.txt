🔥 FINAL EXAM MEMORY BLOCK

Expression Tree = Binary Tree
Leaf → Operand
Internal → Operator
Build using Postfix + Stack
Evaluate using Postorder
Inorder → Infix
Preorder → Prefix
Postorder → Postfix

🔹 Q17) Expression tree for A + B * C

Which node is the root?

Expression:
A + B * C

Step 1: Apply operator precedence

* has higher precedence than +

So expression is actually:

A + (B * C)

Step 2: Build the expression tree
        +
       / \
      A   *
         / \
        B   C

Observation:

+ combines the two main parts of the expression

Therefore + is the ROOT

✅ Correct answer: A. +

🧠 One-line memory:
The last operator applied (lowest precedence) becomes the root.



🔹 Q19) Which traversal preserves operator precedence implicitly?
Meaning of the question:

Which traversal prints the expression in a way that operator precedence is naturally visible?

Consider the same tree:
        +
       / \
      A   *
         / \
        B   C

Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)
A + B * C


✔ * appears closer to operands
✔ Precedence is naturally preserved
✔ No extra symbols needed

Other traversals:

Preorder → + A * B C ❌

Postorder → A B C * + ❌

Level order → + A * B C ❌

They do not show precedence clearly.
