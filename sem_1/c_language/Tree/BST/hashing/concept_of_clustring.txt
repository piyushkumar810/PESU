🔹 What is CLUSTERING in Hashing?

👉 Clustering means

Keys group together in the hash table, creating long blocks of occupied slots.

This causes:

More collisions

Slower search / insertion

Poor performance

🔹 Why clustering happens?

Because collision resolution methods often probe nearby locations repeatedly.

📊 CLUSTERING COMPARISON TABLE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Collision Resolution Technique	Primary Clustering	Secondary Clustering	Explanation
Linear Probing	✅ YES	❌ NO	Collisions create long continuous blocks
Quadratic Probing	❌ NO	✅ YES	Same probe sequence for same initial hash
Double Hashing	❌ NO	❌ NO	Different step size → different probe paths
Separate Chaining	❌ NO	❌ NO	Uses linked lists, no probing
🔹 TYPES OF CLUSTERING (EXAM DEFINITIONS)
🔴 1. Primary Clustering

📌 Occurs in Linear Probing

Visualize:
Index:  2  3  4  5  6
Table: [ ][X][X][X][ ]


One collision → small block

More collisions → block grows

New keys always attach to same block

🧠 Exam line:

Linear probing suffers from primary clustering

🔵 2. Secondary Clustering

📌 Occurs in Quadratic Probing

Why?

Keys with same hash value

Follow same quadratic sequence

Example:

h(k) + 1², 2², 3² ...


Different keys → same path → clustering

🧠 Exam line:

Quadratic probing eliminates primary but causes secondary clustering

🟢 3. No Clustering

📌 Double Hashing

Why?
h(k, i) = (h1(k) + i × h2(k)) mod m


Step size depends on key

Different keys → different probe sequences

🧠 Exam line:

Double hashing avoids both primary and secondary clustering
